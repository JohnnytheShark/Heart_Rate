      <p>Still working on branding for this application, but here is the broad overview.
        I wanted to create an application that would allow me to better visualize my runs, workouts, and sprints. 
        This came out of a desire to understand my heart. Long story short, I was born with a heart condition, underwent surgery for it, and now I just want to understand what makes my heart tick during workouts.
